CI/CD implementation using github actions.

We can automate the complete process of integrating the changes and testing the changes using github actions.

After the testing get completed and all the test cases get passed then we can build a docker image of application and deploy it on the desired enviroment.


I have created a automated process in which as soon as any developer push the changes on dev environment, the github workflow get trigger 
which run the test cases and after comletion it builds an image and deploy it on google cloun run.

File : build-deploy.yml
